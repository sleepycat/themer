Themer is the interface for prepping templates from Freecsstemplates.com for use as themes in ETFPlus.

To access the themer shell script from any folder use the following command:
export PATH=$PATH:/whereever/the/script/is

ie: export PATH=$PATH:/home/mike/projects/themer_test/

then you can use it wherever your eftplus folder is. The environmental variable this sets up will need to be recreated next time you boot up...

I've been testing this in IRB like this:

mike@sleepycat:~$ cd projects/themer_test/
mike@sleepycat:~/projects/themer_test$ irb
irb(main):001:0> load 'lib/themer/template_file.rb'
=> true
irb(main):002:0> tmp = EftPlus::TemplateFile.new "ngtest.html"

Then you can play around with it. The method "extract_class_to_partial" expects to place files in the folders found inside the eftplus directory but everything else works anywhere. I am using load here instead of require so I can load the file again if I make some changes to it but just re-issuing the load command and re-instantiating the class.

The EftPlus::FreeCssTemplates class will really only work within the eftplus dir.

To build a new version of the gem:
gem build

and then install with 

sudo gem install themer-0.0.X.gem
